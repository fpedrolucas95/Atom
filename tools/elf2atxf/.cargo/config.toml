# Override parent config to build for host target
# This is a host tool, not a UEFI application
#
# By explicitly setting [build] without a target, we override
# the parent's x86_64-unknown-uefi target and use the default
# host target (works on both Linux and Windows)

[build]
# No target specified - use host default

# Don't use build-std for this tool (it's a normal std program)
[unstable]
# Empty - don't inherit parent's build-std settings
